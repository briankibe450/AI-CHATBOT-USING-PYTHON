# AI-ChatBot-with-Python
Welcome to AI-CHATBOT-USING-PYTHON! This project is all about creating an intelligent chatbot using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries by matching them with a suitable response from a predefined dataset. It's an excellent starting point for anyone interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or building their own AI chat systems.

Features
Natural Language Understanding: Utilizes NLTK's powerful language processing capabilities to parse and understand user inputs.
Customizable Responses: Includes a simple framework to add, modify, or remove responses, making it easy to tailor the chatbot to specific needs.
Interactive Chat Interface: A user-friendly chat interface that allows for easy interaction with the chatbot.
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


Before you can run this chatbot, you need the following installed:

Python 3.x
NLTK library
Any additional libraries listed in requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/briankibe450/AI-CHATBOT-USING-PYTHON.git
cd AI-CHATBOT-USING-PYTHON
Install required libraries
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the chatbot
To start the chatbot, run:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the chatbot.

How It Works
The chatbot works by processing user inputs using NLTK's language processing tools. It breaks down sentences to understand the context and meaning, then matches the input with the most appropriate response from a predefined dataset. The chatbot.txt file contains the dataset of inputs and responses, which you can customize as needed.

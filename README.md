# AI Chatbot using Python

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using Python programming language. The chatbot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a pre-trained language model to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface:** The chatbot provides a user-friendly conversational interface where users can interact with it by typing their queries or statements.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The chatbot utilizes NLP techniques to understand the user's input and extract meaning from it. It processes the input text, identifies intent, and extracts relevant information.

- **Pre-trained Language Model:** The chatbot leverages a pre-trained language model to generate responses based on the user's input. The language model has been trained on a large corpus of text data and can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.

- **Customization:** The chatbot can be easily customized to fit specific use cases. You can add new intents, define custom responses, and train the chatbot on domain-specific data to improve its performance.

## Prerequisites

To run the AI Chatbot, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pip (Python package manager)
- nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
- tensorflow (for working with pre-trained language models)
- numpy (for numerical computations)

You can install the required libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install nltk tensorflow numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the chatbot script:

   ```
   python chatbot.py
   ```

5. Once the chatbot is running, you can start interacting with it by typing your queries or statements.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot to better suit your needs. Here are a few customization options:

- **Intents:** Modify or add new intents in the `intents.json` file. Each intent should have a list of patterns (user queries) and responses.

- **Responses:** Update the responses in the `intents.json` file to tailor them to your specific use case.

- **Training:** Train the chatbot on domain-specific data to improve its performance in a specific domain. You can update the training data in the `intents.json` file and retrain the chatbot accordingly.
